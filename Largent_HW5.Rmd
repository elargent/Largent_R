1) We explore vector declarations in R. The answer to each problem v1 + the letter of the particular problem. The one exception is for 1.d. where the answer is tmp.

```{r}
v1a <- c(1:20)
v1b <- c(20:1)
v1c <- c(1:20,19:1)
tmp <- c(4,6,3)
v1e <- rep(tmp,10)
v1f <- c(rep(tmp,10),4)
v1g <- rep(tmp,c(10,20,30))
```

2) A vector is created by taking advantage of R's pithy syntax. The answer to 2 is v2. 

```{r}
v2 <- exp(seq(3,6,.1))*cos(seq(3,6,.1))
```

3) Two vectors are created by taking advantage of R's pithy syntax. The answer to 3.a. is v3a, and the answer to 3.b is v3b.

```{r}
v3a <- (rep(.1,34)**c(3:36))*(rep(.2,34)**c(1:34))
v3b <- (rep(2,25)**c(1:25))/c(1:25)
```

4) Two scalars are computed and this is done using for loops. The answer for 4.a. is s4a, and the answer for 4.b. is s4b. Note that these calculations can also be made using only vector operations and the sum function. 

```{r}
tmp4a <- c(10:100)
for(i in tmp4a) {
  tmp4a[i] = i**3 + 4*i**2
}
s4a = sum(tmp4a)
tmp4b <- c(1:25)
for(i in tmp4b) {
  tmp4b[i] = 2**i/i + 3**i/i**2
}
s4b = sum(tmp4b)
```

5) Two vectors are created using R's paste function. The answer to 5.a. is v5a, and the answer to 5.b. is v5b.

```{r}
v5a <- paste(rep("label",30),c(1:30),sep=" ")
v5b <- paste(rep("fn",30),c(1:30),sep="")
```

6) This problem has us creating creating vectors by using the xVec and yVec vectors we are given. In this case, the output vectors are not the same length as the input vector. The answers are labeled similar to the other problems. 

```{r}
set.seed(50)
xVec <- sample(0:999,250,replace=T)
yVec <- sample(0:999,250,replace=T)

v6a <- yVec[2:250] - xVec[1:249]
v6b <- sin(yVec[1:249])/cos(xVec[2:250])
v6c <- xVec[1:248]+2*xVec[2:249]-xVec[3:250]
s6d <- sum(exp(-xVec[2:250])/(xVec[1:249]+10))
```

7) This problem uses the xVec and yVec vectors created in the previous problem. These lines are a bit more complex. In particular, on v7b we create a vector of type boolean that indicates what points in the vector are greater than 600 and then uses this boolean vector to pull values from a vector where each item refers to the number of the entry in the vector. Maybe the code makes more sense...

```{r}
v7a <- yVec[yVec > 600]
v7b <- c(1:length(yVec))[rank(yVec)>(length(yVec)-length(yVec[yVec > 600]))]
v7c <- xVec[v7b]
v7d <- sqrt(abs(xVec-mean(xVec)))
s7e <- length(yVec[yVec>(max(xVec)-200)])
s7f <- length(yVec[yVec %% 2 == 0])
s7g <- yVec[order(xVec)]
s7h <- yVec[seq(1,250,3)]  
```

8)

```{r}
s8 <- sum(cumprod(c(1,seq(2,38,2))/seq(1,39,2)))
```
